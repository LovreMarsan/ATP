#2017 Earth expedition
	
	
	So perhaps you read about the EXPORTS cruise and have heard about this place called Station P. You are now probably wondering why NASA would fund a mission that includes two research vessels spending over three weeks at this place?  Well, to some, Station P (also known as Ocean Station Papa or P26) is simply a point on a map in the middle of the North Pacific Ocean â€“ latitude 50 degrees north, longitude 145 degrees west.  But to others it is much more than that.
